# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
This brain tumor detection, classification, and diagnosis system with high accuracy (95%) that uses state of the art Deep Learning methods. In this proposed model, a pretrained CNN architecture is employed for the classification  that uses many labeled images for training the model obtained from large scale datasets like ImageNet and Kaggle.
